Test Plan:

Test 1:
	Input: 
	./a.out foo.txt 

	Output: 
	Enter in one of the following commands: ’c’ list the current file to /dev/tty
 	’d’ copy the current file (duplicate)
 	’r’ rename the current file
 	’u’ delete (unlink) the current file
 	’t’ zero (length) the current file
 	’a’ append the current file to another file
 	’l’ display the last 100 bytes of the current file
 	’m’ change the current file’s access permissions
 	’x’ change the current file’s access time to the current time 
 	’n’ goto the next name (i.e., the next file)
 	’q’ quit
	open: Success
	File: foo.txt Command: q

	Explanation:
	In this script, I tested to see if the q command would successfully quit. It did.

Test 2:
	Input:
	./a.out foo.txt

	Output:
	Enter in one of the following commands: ’c’ list the current file to /dev/tty
	 ’d’ copy the current file (duplicate)
 	’r’ rename the current file
 	’u’ delete (unlink) the current file
 	’t’ zero (length) the current file
 	’a’ append the current file to another file
	’l’ display the last 100 bytes of the current file
 	’m’ change the current file’s access permissions
 	’x’ change the current file’s access time to the current time 
 	’n’ goto the next name (i.e., the next file)
 	’q’ quit
	open: Success
	File: foo.txt Command: l
 	Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.
	close: Bad file descriptor
	File: foo.txt Command: q

	Explanation:
	In this script, I tested to see if the l command would properly displace the last 100 bytes.

Test 3:
	Input:
	./a.out foo.txt

	Output:
 	-rw------- 1 jpirone jpirone  2312 Feb 10  1969 foo.txt 

	Enter in one of the following commands: ’c’ list the current file to /dev/tty
 	’d’ copy the current file (duplicate)
 	’r’ rename the current file
 	’u’ delete (unlink) the current file
 	’t’ zero (length) the current file
 	’a’ append the current file to another file
 	’l’ display the last 100 bytes of the current file
 	’m’ change the current file’s access permissions
 	’x’ change the current file’s access time to the current time 
 	’n’ goto the next name (i.e., the next file)
 	’q’ quit
	open: Success
	File: foo.txt Command: m
	Type what permission to change: 
	700
	Changed mode.
	File: foo.txt Command: q
    
        -rwx------ 1 jpirone jpirone  2312 Feb 10  1969 foo.txt     
  
	Explanation:
	In this script, I tested to see if the chmod command would work to change the file's permission.

Test 4: 
	Input:
	./a.out foo.txt 

	Output:
	Enter in one of the following commands: ’c’ list the current file to /dev/tty
 	’d’ copy the current file (duplicate)
 	’r’ rename the current file
 	’u’ delete (unlink) the current file
 	’t’ zero (length) the current file
 	’a’ append the current file to another file
 	’l’ display the last 100 bytes of the current file
 	’m’ change the current file’s access permissions
 	’x’ change the current file’s access time to the current time 
	’n’ goto the next name (i.e., the next file)
        ’q’ quit
	open: Success
	File: foo.txt Command: x
	Here is the time: Fri Feb 10 03:10:19 2017
	File: foo.txt Command: q

	Explanation:
	This script tested to see if the x command would change the access time to the current time.

Test 5: 
	Input:
	./a.out foo.txt

	Output:
	Enter in one of the following commands: ’c’ list the current file to /dev/tty
 	’d’ copy the current file (duplicate)
	 ’r’ rename the current file
	 ’u’ delete (unlink) the current file
 	’t’ zero (length) the current file
 	’a’ append the current file to another file
 	’l’ display the last 100 bytes of the current file
 	’m’ change the current file’s access permissions
 	’x’ change the current file’s access time to the current time 
 	’n’ goto the next name (i.e., the next file)
 	’q’ quit
	File: foo.txt Command: l
 	Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.
	File: foo.txt Command: a
	Enter in file destination: dino.txt
	File appended to: dino.txt
	File: foo.txt Command: r
	Enter in new name: 
	foo1.txt
	File successfully renamed
	File: foo1.txt Command: q

	Explanation: 
	This script tested to see if the l, a, and r commands would all work properly. All successes!
